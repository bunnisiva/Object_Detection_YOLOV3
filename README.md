# Object_Detection_YOLOV3
This is from udacity nano degree  , I am using their base script which is in python, I am trying to implement it in pytorch ! I found Ayuush Katuria script on pagescape very clear and easy to understand !
I want to create my own layers in pytorch on the conv side and adopt it with darknet and see how good the network can detect objects .
I will be using the dataset provided for training .
I will be feeding the network image of my choice to see how good it generalizes to unseen data 
Million thanks to Ayuush Katuria for providing pytorch work flow ! on paperspace !! It is a s set of 4 tutorials all done very clearly !
